This feature is entirely optional and will only sync your data if you explicitly opt in. While we employ best practices to secure your data, please note that this feature is still in development, and its functionality is not guaranteed. By using this feature, you acknowledge that there may be limitations or interruptions in service during the beta phase. We recommend keeping local backups of your data for added security.</p>

These cookies help us understand usage patterns and serve relevant advertisements. By using the app, you consent to the placement of these cookies on your device.</p>
<p>Google Analytics is used to track anonymized usage data to help us improve the app. Google AdSense may use cookies to display personalized ads based on your interests and browsing behavior. You can manage your ad preferences or opt out of personalized ads through Google's Ad Settings.</p>
